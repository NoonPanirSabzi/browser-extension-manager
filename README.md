## My process

### Built with

- HTML/CSS/JS

### What I learned

- In CSS variables, you can store **any string value** that represents a property value â€” even complex ones like `box-shadow`.  
  Example: define two different `box-shadow` values in separate variables for different themes (light/dark) and switch between them dynamically.
- Setting `appearance: none;` on an input element **does not** remove it from the accessibility tree or keyboard navigation. It will still receive focus via the keyboard.
- Hiding an element with `visibility: hidden;` or `display: none;` **does** remove it from keyboard navigation.
- so If you want the element hidden visually but still accessible, use `appearance: none;` or `opacity: 0;`.
- Create a switch toggle using HTML and CSS by styling a checkbox or radio input with custom visuals.
- If a child element is absolutely positioned with `top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0;`, it will expand to fill the **entire width and height** of its parent.
- Use `JSON.stringify()` to store complex data structures in `localStorage`.
- Use `JSON.parse()` to retrieve and convert them back into JavaScript objects.
- `Promise.all()` is used when you have multiple promises and want to execute code **only after all of them have resolved**.  
  If any promise rejects, `Promise.all()` immediately rejects with that error.
